#Starting Now!

First we test to see normality

```{r shapiro wilk}

#DON"T USE THIS DATA SET, includes one day!

Fourweekdata<-read.csv(file="D:/Dropbox (Smithsonian)/Alaska Dvex Eradication/Sitka D.vex/2018 Sitka DATA/Dvex4week_Models_May2019.csv",header=T)
shapiro.test(Fourweekdata$ChangeCover)
library("nortest", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.5")
ad.test(Fourweekdata$ChangeCover)citat

library(car)
leveneTest(ChangeCover ~ Treatment, Fourweekdata, center=mean)

```

Since its normal, now we run the model set ups to see best AIC


```{r }
fourweekmdl<- lm(ChangeCover ~ Type * Treatment * TimePeriod, data=Fourweekdata)
summary(fourweekmdl)
AIC(fourweekmdl) 
null<- lm(ChangeCover ~ 1, data=Fourweekdata)
AIC(null) 
summary(null)

fourweekmdl2<- lm(ChangeCover ~ Type, data=Fourweekdata)
AIC(fourweekmdl2)

fourweekmdl3<- lm(ChangeCover ~ Type*Treatment, data=Fourweekdata)
AIC(fourweekmdl3)

fourweekmdl4<- lm(ChangeCover ~ Type*TimePeriod, data=Fourweekdata)
AIC(fourweekmdl4)

fourweekmdl5<- lm(ChangeCover ~ Treatment, data=Fourweekdata)
AIC(fourweekmdl5)

fourweekmdl6<- lm(ChangeCover ~ TimePeriod*Treatment, data=Fourweekdata)
AIC(fourweekmdl6)
summary(fourweekmdl6)

fourweekmdl7<- lm(ChangeCover ~ TimePeriod, data=Fourweekdata)
AIC(fourweekmdl7)

anova(fourweekmdl6)
```

Looks like fourweekmdl6 is best fit. With Time Period (ie 1day Post, or 4 weeks post) and Treament (Treated or Control).
Treatment (treated or control) does seem to be the most important factor. Interesting that Type (ie. Complex or Simple) wasn't in the winning model.

##wait i fucked up.. should one day be in the model? no controls have 1 day

I originally had the "difference in PC" from day 0 to day 1 but since no controls got a day 1 score, that was a lot of 0s "no change" which I think is unfair. So lets just do the change from day 0 to week 4
Since its normal, now we run the model set ups to see best AIC


```{r }
four.fixed.data<- subset(Fourweekdata, TimePeriod == "FourWeeks")
data$Month<- c("May","May","July","July","July","May","July","July","May","May","July","July","July","May","July",
          "July")

four.fixed.data.c<- subset(four.fixed.data, Type == "Complex")
four.fixed.data.s<- subset(four.fixed.data, Type == "Simple")
kruskal.test(ChangeCover ~ Treatment, data = four.fixed.data.c)
kruskal.test(ChangeCover ~ Treatment, data = four.fixed.data.s)

shapiro.test(data$ChangeCover)
library("nortest", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.5")
ad.test(data$ChangeCover)

library(car)
leveneTest(ChangeCover ~ Treatment, data, center=mean)

fourweek2mdl<- lm(ChangeCover ~ Type * Treatment, data=data)
summary(fourweek2mdl)
AIC(fourweek2mdl) 
null<- lm(ChangeCover ~ 1, data=data)
AIC(null) 
summary(null)
anova(fourweek2mdl)
summary(aov(ChangeCover ~ Type * Treatment, data=data))

fourweek2mdl2<- lm(ChangeCover ~ Type, data=data)
AIC(fourweek2mdl2)

fourweek2mdl3<- lm(ChangeCover ~ Treatment + Type, data=data)
AIC(fourweek2mdl3)

fourweek2mdl5<- lm(ChangeCover ~ Treatment, data=data)
AIC(fourweek2mdl5)
summary(fourweek2mdl5)
#this one works as well as forweek2mdl but fits less good when plotted
anova(fourweek2mdl5)


fourweek2mdl6<- lm(ChangeCover ~ Type * Treatment*Month, data=data)
summary(fourweek2mdl6)
#Ok great Month deployed doesn't seem to matter
```


Treatment (treated or control) seems to be the most important factor. Interesting that Type (ie. Complex or Simple) doesn't have a big impact.

Now lets try for the 8 weeks? This is between the 4 week timepoint and 8 week

```{r}
Eightweekdata<-read.csv(file="D:/Dropbox (Smithsonian)/Alaska Dvex Eradication/Sitka D.vex/2018 Sitka DATA/Dvex8week_Models_May2019.csv",header=T)
shapiro.test(Eightweekdata$ChangeCover4to8)
library("nortest", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.5")
ad.test(Eightweekdata$ChangeCover4to8)
```
Ok ad.test doesn't work on <7 items... makes sense, but can only use the shapiro test here
```{r}

eightweekmdl<- lm(ChangeCover4to8 ~ Treatment, data=Eightweekdata)
summary(eightweekmdl)
AIC(eightweekmdl)
nulleight <- lm(ChangeCover4to8 ~ 1, data=Eightweekdata)
AIC(nulleight)
```
Ok just barely beats the null and not very sig. pvalues - makes sense since so few data points and 4 and 8 weeks are pretty similar

``` {r}

shapiro.test(Eightweekdata$ChangeCover1to8)

eightweekmdl2<- lm(ChangeCover1to8 ~ Treatment, data=Eightweekdata)
summary(eightweekmdl2)
anova(eightweekmdl2)
AIC(eightweekmdl2)
nulleight2 <- lm(ChangeCover1to8 ~ 1, data=Eightweekdata)
AIC(nulleight2)

eightweekmdl3<- lm(ChangeCover1to8 ~ Treatment * Type, data=Eightweekdata)
summary(eightweekmdl3)
anova(eightweekmdl3)

```

Yep ok beats the null in this case. surprising since there's so few replicates

Now lets plot the residuals to check fit


```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fourweekmdl6)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fourweek2mdl)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fourweek2mdl5)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(eightweekmdl2)
```
