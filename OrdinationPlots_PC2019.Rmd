##NMDS trial for Point Counts

This is primary points, absolute values

# `metaMDS` requires a community-by-species matrix
# Let's create that matrix with some randomly sampled data


# The function `metaMDS` will take care of most of the distance 
# calculations, iterative fitting, etc. We need simply to supply:
PriAbs_NMDS=metaMDS(community_matrix, # Our community-by-species matrix
                     k=2) # The number of reduced dimensions
# You should see each iteration of the NMDS until a solution is reached
# (i.e., stress was minimized after some number of reconfigurations of 
# the points in 2 dimensions). You can increase the number of default 
# iterations using the argument "trymax=##"
example_NMDS=metaMDS(community_matrix,k=2,trymax=100)

# And we can look at the NMDS object
example_NMDS # metaMDS has automatically applied a square root 
# transformation and calculated the Bray-Curtis distances for our 
# community-by-site matrix
# Let's examine a Shepard plot, which shows scatter around the regression
# between the interpoint distances in the final configuration (distances 
# between each pair of communities) against their original dissimilarities
stressplot(example_NMDS)
# Large scatter around the line suggests that original dissimilarities are
# not well preserved in the reduced number of dimensions

#Now we can plot the NMDS
plot(example_NMDS)
# It shows us both the communities ("sites", open circles) and species 
# (red crosses), but we  don't know which are which!
